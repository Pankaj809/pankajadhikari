### Hi, I'm Pankaj Adhikari 👋

I'm a researcher and developer currently pursuing my **Master's in Software Engineering** at **Nankai University** in China.

My focus is on applying AI to a field that definitely needs it: government transparency.

I'm currently using **AI Research** and **Prompt Engineering** to develop systems for **government projects**, aiming to enhance accountability in local and national bodies. 

This profile is where I document my projects, code, and research.
